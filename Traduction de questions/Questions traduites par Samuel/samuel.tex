We need to find the y-axis intercept.\\
Here is a plot of the function $f\left(x\right)= 4\left\vert
x-3\right\vert+5$ :

\end{center}
The \emph{y}-axis intercept is the value of \emph{f(x)} when $x=0$.
Here is the algebra:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f\left(0\right)
&=& 4\left\vert0-3\right\vert+5\\
&=& 4\left\vert-3\right\vert+5\\
&=& 4\times3+5\\
&=& 17
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\


4004-- My savings are in an account at the bank. The evolution of
the total amount of money $A$ in my account increases with time $t$
(number of years) and is described by the following function :\\
$A = 5\,000\left(1.05\right)^{t}$.\\
How much money was there initially in my account?\\

R\'eponse : 5000\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We want to find the initial amount. Since $A$ increases as a
function of $t$ like $5\,000\left(1.05\right)^{x}$, the initial
amount is equal to the value of $A$ when $t$ is equal to 0.
\begin{eqnarray*}
A
&=& 5\,000\times\left(1.05\right)^{0}\\
&=& 5\,000\times1\\
&=& 5\,000
\end{eqnarray*}

The answer can also be read off the plot of the function $A=
5\,000\left(1,05\right)^{x}$.

    \end{center}
The zeros are the values of $x$ when $f\left(x\right)= 0$. Since
$f(x)$ is never equal to zero, the function does not have any zeros.\\
Therefore, the answer is a$)$.\\


4010-- Ann has a cellular phone and pays by the minute. If she
speaks 50 seconds, a full minute is charged. The first two minutes
of a call cost 0.30 \$ each and extra minutes cost 0.05 \$ each. The
price of calls as a function of duration is shown on the following
plot:

\begin{center}

What are the possible prices for a call?\\

a$)$ All the multiples of 0.05 \$ and 0.3 \$.\\
b$)$ All the multiples of 0.05 over 0.55 \$, then 0.3 \$.\\
c$)$ All the multiples of 0.05 \$.\\

% fonction10.eps : 300dpi, width=3.39cm, height=3.39cm, bb=0 0 400 400
    \end{center}

We are looking for the possible prices of a call. In fact, we need
to find the codomain of the function plotted or in other words, the
interval of its possible outputs. The codomain is
$\left\lbrace0,3,\,\, 0,6+0,05n\right\rbrace$,
where $n\, \epsilon\, \mathbb{N}$.\\
Therefore, the answer is b$)$.\\


4012-- What is the domain of the function $f\left(x\right)$?

$f\left(x\right)=a \sqrt{x-h}+k$\\
\end{center}

a$)$ $]-\infty,\, h]$\\[2mm]
b$)$ $]-\infty,\, k]$\\[2mm]
c$)$ $[h, \,\infty[$\\[2mm]
d$)$ $[k,\,\infty[$\\

R\'eponse : c$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the domain of the function $f\left(x\right)=a
\sqrt{x-h}+k$. The domain is the interval of values that the
variable $x$ can take. The function is only defined when
$(x-h)\geqslant 0$.
thus, we have : $x\geqslant h$. The domain is $[h, \,\infty[$.\\
Therefore, the answer is c$)$.\\


4013-- Your friend opens the fridge to get some juice. The initial
temperature of the liquid is 4 degrees Celsius. He forgets the glass
of juice on the countertop. The liquid warms up following this rule:
\begin{center}
$f\left(x\right) = -17\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{x}+21$
\end{center}
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=13cm]{fonction13.eps}

\end{center}
What is the temperature of the room the glass of juice is in?\\

R\'eponse : 21\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the room temperature. The juice will warm up and
reach the room temperature after a very long time. To find the room
temperature, we find the supremum of the function $f\left(x\right) =
-17\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{x}+21$.
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=13cm]{fonction13.eps}
 % fonction13.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
The codomain of the function $f(x)$ is $\left[4,21\right[$. The
supremum of this set is $21$. As you can see on the plot, the
function tends to $21$ as $x$ goes to infinity. In fact, as $x$ gets
larger, the term $\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^{x}$ gets very close to
zero. In the limit when $x$ is very large, $f\left(x\right) =
-17\times 0+21 = 21$.\\
Therefore, the answer is $21$.\\


4016-- What is the codomain of the function?

Here is a plot of the function $f\left(x\right) = -4\left\vert x-2

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=8cm]{fonction16.eps}
 % fonction16.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
We are looking for the codomain of $f(x)$. The codomain of a
function is the set of all its possible outputs. The codomain of a
function of the type $f\left(x\right) = a\left\vert x-k \right\vert
+b$ is $]-\infty,\, k]$, if $a$ is negative. In this case $k$ is
equal to 2 and the codomain is $]-\infty,\, 5]$. The other answer
choices, $\mathbb{R}$ and $]-\infty,\, 2]$, correspond to the domain
and the interval of growth respectively.\\
The answer is $a)$.\\


4018-- Water slides have to be built at an aquatic park. The height
of a particular slide is described by the function
$h\left(x\right)=-\sqrt{4x}+6$, where $x$ is positive.
The units of $f(x)$ and $x$ are meters. How high is that slide?\\

R\'eponse : 6\\

R\'etroaction :\\

The height of the slide slide is described by the function
$h\left(x\right)=-\sqrt{4x}+6$ and the function is bounded in the first quadrant ($x$ is real).\\
Here is a plot:
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=8cm]{fonction18.eps}
 % fonction18.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
We are looking for the height of the slide. We have to find the span
of the codomain of $h(x)$, \emph{i.e.} the size of the interval of
values that $h\left(x\right)$ can give. The answer is $\left[0,\,
6\right]$. So, the top of the slides is six meters off the ground.
The slide is 6 meter high and the answer is $6$.\\


4019-- The intensity of the alternative current changes with time
like a sinusoidal function.

What is the range of amplitudes the current can take?\\

a$)$ $\left]-\infty,\, 100\right]$\\
b$)$ $\left[-100,\, 100\right]$\\
c$)$ $\left[-100,\, \infty\right[$\\
d$)$ $\mathbb{R}$\\

R\'eponse : b$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

The intensity of the alternative current changes with time like a
sine function.
\begin{center}
$I\left(t\right)=100\sin\left(30\pi t\right)$
\end{center}
Here is a plot:
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=8cm]{fonction19.eps}
 % fonction19.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
We need to know what values the function $I\left(t\right)$ can take, \emph{i.e.} its codomain.\\

As you can see on the plot, the function's minimum is -100 and its
maximum is 100.\\

In order to see this algebraically, you have to know that a sine
function of amplitude 1 takes values between -1 and 1. So with an
amplitude of 100 (without any vertical offset), our function ranges
from -100 to 100. Therefore, the codomain is $[-100, 100]$ and the answer is b$)$.\\


4020-- In chemistry, the acidity of substances is measured by a
quantity called $pH$. The pH is a function of hydrogen ions
concentration $x$, in moles per liter of solution and is determined
by the equation:
\begin{center}
$\textnormal{pH}=-\log(x)$
\end{center}
What values can the pH take if the concentration in moles per liter
ranges between $1\times10^{-14}$ and $0.1$?\\

a$)$ $\left]-\infty,\, 0\right]$\\
b$)$ $\left[0,\, \infty\right]$\\
c$)$ $\left[1,\, 14\right]$\\
d$)$ $\mathbb{R}$\\

R\'eponse : c$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We want to find the range of values the pH can take, that is, the
codomain of the function $\textnormal{pH}=-\log(x)$. Since the
domain is bounded, so is the codomain. For a concentration of
$1\times10^{-14}$, the pH is $-\log(1\times10^{-14})=14$ and for a
concentration of $0.1$, the
pH is $-\log(0.1)=1$. So the codomain is $[1, 14]$.\\

Therefore, the answer is c$)$.\\


4024-- The surface area $A$ of a square can be found from its
perimeter $P$ with the function $A=(P/4)^{2}$. What function gives the value of the perimeter from the surface?\\

a$)$ $P=4\sqrt{A}$\\[2mm]
b$)$ $P=16\sqrt{A}$\\[2mm]
c$)$ $P=16A^{2}$\\[2mm]
d$)$ $P=256A^{2}$\\

R\'eponse : a$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for an equation that gives the perimeter of a square
from the value of its surface. In other words, we want to inverse
the function $A=(P/4)^{2}$. We have to isolate the variable $P$.\\
Here is the algebra :\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
A &=& (P/4)^{2}\\
\sqrt{A} &=&(P/4) \\
4\sqrt{A} &=& P
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the answer is a$)$.\\


4026-- Which function describes correctly the plot below?\\
\begin{center}

d$)$ $f\left(x\right) = 3\left\vert 4x+5 \right\vert +15$\\

R\'eponse : a$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We want to find the function represented on the plot below:

    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{fonction26.eps}
% fonction26.eps : 300dpi, width=3.39cm, height=3.39cm, bb=0 0 400 400
    \end{center}
This is clearly a function of the form $f\left(x\right) =
a\left\vert bx+c \right\vert +d$. In this case, $a$ is negative and
$c$ = $+\frac{5}{4}$.\\[2mm]

The function $f(x) = -3\left\vert 4\left(x-\frac{5}{4}\right) \right\vert +15$ seems appropriate.\\[2mm]
The answer is a$)$.\\


4028-- The director of a great company wants to build a phone chain
to join the $10,000$ employees. He calls $5$ employees that each
call $5$ and so on. To visualize the chain, he wants to represent
the relationship between the group number of employees that are
calling and the number of people reached. The first group is made of
the director and the $5$ he's joining are the second group, so on.\\

True or false?\\
The function $f\left(x\right)=10\,000(5)^{x} $ represents the situation.\\

R\'eponse : False\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the equation that rules the situation. The director joins $5$ employees who are joining $5$ people each, etc.\\
Here's a table that resumes.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|}
\hline
Group number & Number of people reached\\
\hline
1 & 5\\
2 & 25\\
3 & 125\\
4 & 625\\
5 & 3125\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

When the group number increases by $1$, the number of people is $5$
times higher. So the equation is a base 5 exponential function. We
then have:
\begin{center}
$f\left(x\right)=5^{x}$
\end{center}
Therefore, the answer is : false.\\


4034-- During the spring, I empty my pool with a pump that has a
flow rate of four cubic meters an hour so I can fill it with clean
water using the same pump. My pool contains 54 cubic meter of water

spring. How long will it take to empty the pool and how long to fill
it up?\\

a$)$ 4,5 hours and 9 hours\\
b$)$ 4,5 hours and 13,5 hours\\
c$)$ 9 hours and 13,5 hours\\
d$)$ 9 hours and 22,5 hours\\

R\'eponse : c$)$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the time to empty the pool and the time to fill it completely.\\
Because it contains 54 cubic meters when full and is filled to its
two third, it contains $\frac{2}{3}$ of $54 = 36$ cubic meters
before emptying in the spring. With $4$ cubic meters of flow rate,
the
time needed to empty the pool is:\\[2mm]
$\frac{36}{4}=9$\\

So the pool is empty after 9 hours. The time needed to fill it completely is:\\[2mm]
$\frac{54}{4}=13,5$\\

Therefore, the answer is c$)$.\\


4036-- Mark has decided to buy a brand new car. It costs $20\,000$
dollars. He wants to know what will be the reselling price $P$ of
the car in $x$ years knowing that the price changes with time
according to:

\begin{center}
$P=19\,500(0,85)^{x}+500$
\end{center}

True or false?\\
The rising interval of the function is $\left[0, \,\infty\right[$.\\

R\'eponse : False\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the rising interval of the function
$P=19\,500(0,85)^{x}+500$. It is obvious on the graphic that the
function is decreasing over the interval $\left[0, \infty\right[$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{fonction36.eps}\\
% fonction36.eps : 300dpi, width=3.39cm, height=3.39cm, bb=0 0 400 400
\end{center}
We can also see with the canonical form of the function
$f\left(x\right)=ac^{b\left(x-h\right)}+k$ that the $c$ parameter of
the exponential function is less than $1$ and the $a$ parameter is
greater than $1$. So it is strictly decreasing and the interval
$\left[0, \infty\right[$ is then a decreasing one.\\
Therefore, the answer is : false.\\


4038-- Annie is studying bacteria. To do so, she needs at least
$100\,000$ bacteria. As the number of bacteria increases, a
relationship tells that number as a function of time in days:

When are looking for the time needed for Annie to have at least $100\,\,000$ bacteria.\\
We want to find $f\left(100\,\,000\right)$. Here's how to do it:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f\left(100\,000\right) &=& \log_{2}100\,000\\
f\left(100\,000\right) &=& \frac{\log 100\,000}{\log 2}\\
f\left(100\,000\right) &=& 16,61

my profit is $6\,460$ dollars?\\

R\'eponse : 17\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the number of years the amount has been in the
account so that the profit is $6\,460$ dollars. The amount $A$
increases with $x$, in years, following $A=
5000\left(1,05\right)^{x}$.\\ If the profit is $6\,460$ dollars, the
final amount is $5\,000+6\,460=11\,460$ dollars. Then place the
amount in the equation and isolate $x$ in order to find it.
\begin{eqnarray*}
11\,460 &=& 5\,\,000\times\left(1,05\right)^{x}\\
\frac{11\,460}{5\,\,000} &=& \left(1,05\right)^{x}\\
\frac{573}{250} &=& \left(1,05\right)^{x}\\
\log_{1,05}\left(\frac{573}{250}\right) &=& x\\
17 &=& x

4054-- Mark has decided to buy a brand new car. It costs $20\,000$
dollars. He wants to know what will be the reselling price $P$ of
the car in $x$ years knowing that the price changes with time
according to:

\begin{equation*}
f\left(x\right)=a(0,85)^{x}+k
\end{equation*}

After two years, the car is worth  $14\,588,75$ dollars.


What will be the minimal value of the car?\\

R\'eponse : $500\,\$$\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the lowest price the car will get to with time,
that is, the minimum of the function. The $k$ parameter of the
canonical form is the answer.\\
The function is of the form $f\left(x\right)=a(0,85)^{x}+k$.
Moreover, we know two points: $\left(0,\,20\,000\right)$ and
$\left(2,\,14\,588,75\right)$. With those put in the function, the
$a$ and $k$ parameters will be found. We have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
20\,000 &=& a(0,85)^{0}+k\\
20\,000 &=& a(1)+k\\
20\,000-a &=& k
\end{eqnarray*}
and
\begin{eqnarray*}
14\,588,75 &=& a(0,85)^{2}+k\\
14\,588,75 &=& a(0,7225)+k\\
14\,588,75-0,7225a &=& k
\end{eqnarray*}
So by comparing:
\begin{eqnarray*}
20\,000-a &=& 14\,588,75-0,7225a\\
5\,411,25 &=& 0,2775a\\
\frac{5\,411,25}{0,2775} &=& a\\
19\,500= a
\end{eqnarray*}
and by substitution,
\begin{eqnarray*}
20\,000-a &=& k\\

We can transform the inequality in order to find possible solutions

Here's how to do it the first way.
\begin{eqnarray*}
3a+5 &\geq& 8a\\
5 &\geq& 5a\\
1 &\geq& a

So for the inequality to be true, $a$ has to be equal or smaller

3x-18 &<& -4x-5\\
7x &<& 13\\
x &<& \frac{13}{7}

So $x$ has to be smaller than $\frac{13}{7}$. Because
$\frac{13}{7}\nless\frac{13}{7}$, $\frac{13}{7}$  is not a solution

\begin{eqnarray*}

Because the function $f\left(a\right)=a^{2}$ is always positive, the

We can combine conditions one by one. The first and second ones, $x
> -10$ and $x \leq 20$, resume as: $ -10 < x \leq 20$. If the third one is combined,
it resumes the same way because it is more general than the second
one. In fact, the interval $ -10 < x \leq 20$ is totally included in
$x < 25$. If the last condition is added, the value 3 has to be

We are looking for the graphic that represents the following situation:\\
George is a farmer. He has at least two times less calves than cows.
There is room in his farm for no more than 15 calves and

Lets first identify the inequalities inherent to the situation. Let

have:
\begin{center}
$y \leq \frac{x}{2}$\\
$y\leq 15$\\

The intersection is at $\left(30,\,g_1\right)$. We find $g_1$ with:

0,250\times30+0,500g_1&=&22\\
7,5+0,500g_1&=&22\\
0,500g_1&=&14,5\\

The restriction polygon is then:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{alg105.1.eps}
% alg105.1.eps : 300dpi, width=3.39cm, height=3.39cm, bb=0 0 400 400
\end{center}

The polygon vertexes are: $\left(5,\,3\right)$,
$\left(5,\,5\right)$, $\left(8,\,0\right)$ and $\left(10,\,0\right)$.\\

The function to be maximized is $S=5x+8y$ since strawberries baskets
are 5 \$ and raspberries baskets are 8 \$.\\

The earnings are evaluated for each vertex:\\
$\left(5,\,3\right)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $S=5\times5+8\times3=25+24=49$\\
$\left(5,\,5\right)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $S=5\times5+8\times5=25+40=65$\\
$\left(8,\,0\right)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $S=5\times8+8\times0=40+0=40$\\
$\left(10,\,0\right)$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ $S=5\times10+8\times0=50+0=50$\\

So the top salary is 65 \$ and is reached when Jeremy picks 5
baskets of strawberries and 5 baskets of raspberries. The time
needed to pick them is: $T=5\times0,75$ hour $+5\times1$ hour
$=3,75$ hours $+5$
hours$=8,75$ hours.\\

So Jeremy gets 65 \$ in 8,75 hours. He's then payed 7,43 \$/h.\\
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\

4128-- Here are some inequalities:
\begin{eqnarray*}
3x^2+|z|-2y&\geq&5-5x\\

\end{eqnarray*}

True or false?\\
If the constant $J$ takes the value 0 the inequalities are not
equivalent.\\

R\'eponse : False\\

R\'etroaction:\\

The question is to know wether the inequalities are equivalent when
$J$ is worth 0.
\begin{eqnarray*}
3x^2+|z|-2y&\geq&5-5x\\
3x^2-5+5x&\geq&2y+Jx^2-|z|
\end{eqnarray*}
Lets put that value in the inequality and transform it in order to
compare it with the other one:
\begin{eqnarray*}
3x^2-5+5x&\geq&2y+0x^2-|z|\\
3x^2-5+5x&\geq&2y-|z|\\
3x^2-5+5x-2y&\geq&-|z|\\
3x^2-5+5x+|z|-2y&\geq&0\\
3x^2+5x+|z|-2y&\geq&5\\
3x^2+|z|-2y&\geq&5-5x
\end{eqnarray*}
So the two inequalities are equivalent when $J=0$. According to the
question, if the constant $J$ takes the value 0 the inequalities are
not equivalent, the answer is false.\\
Therefore, the answer is : false.\\

We are looking for the inequality among $y\leq4x$, $3+y\leq4x$,
$5+y\geq4x$ and $y\geq4x$ that is totally included in $3+y\geq4x$.\\

All inequalities in this problem are restricted by parallel straight
lines since they all have the same slope which is 4. The inequality
$3+y\geq4x$ is represented by a straight line in black, which y-axis
intersect is at -3, and the space above that line (in yellow and
green) because $y$ is greater than the expression. There has to be
an other inequality which y-axis intersect is greater than -3 and
for which $y$ is greater than the expression. The one that is within
the restrictions is $y\geq4x$. The blue line that bounds the green
region has a y-axis intersect of 0 and $y$ is greater than the
expression.

R\'eponse : c$)$\\

R\'etroaction:\\

We are looking for the inequality among $-5+y\leq-5x$, $3+y\leq5x$,
$5+y\leq-5x$ and $y\geq-5x$, that is totally included in $\frac{3-y}{5}\geq x$.\\

For an inequality to be totally included in an other one, both
straight lines bounding those inequalities have to be parallel. The
answer is then an inequality which slope is the same as the one for
$\frac{3-y}{5}\geq x$. The slope is found like this:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{3-y}{5}&\geq& x\\
3-y&\geq& 5x\\
-y&\geq& 5x-3\\
y&\leq& 3-5x
\end{eqnarray*}
So the line's slope bounding the equation is -5. Among the choices,
the inequations 1, 3 and 4 have slopes of -5.\\
Moreover, the inequality $y\leq 3-5x$ is represented by a black
line, which y-axis intersect is at 3 and the space in yellow and
green below that line, because $y$ is smaller than the expression.
Among 1, 3 and 4, we have to find the one for which the y-axis
intersect is smaller than 3 so $y$ is smaller than the expression.
The inequality $5+y\leq-5x$ is fulfills the conditions with the blue
line bounding the green region, its y-axis intersect at -5 and $y$
is smaller than the expression.

We are looking for the initial value of the situation represented by
Frank working in a shoe store and payed 8 \$ an hour.\\

The independent variable of the situation is the number of hours of

R\'etroaction:\\

We are looking for the amount of money saved by Catherine each week.
We know that she had 345 \$ five weeks ago and now has 420 \$.\\

So in five weeks she saved 420 - 345 = 75 \$. Each week she saved:
$75\$\div5$ weeks $= 15\,\$$ a week. The weekly savings are then 15 \$.\\
Therefore, the answer is 15 \$.\\

The flow rate of the pump is:

a$)$ $-3$ m$^3$ per 30 minutes\\

In 30 minutes, $13-10=3$ m$^3$ of water went trough the pump. The
flow rate is found with: $3$ m$^3\div0,5$ hour $=$ 6 m$^3$ per hour.
So the answer can't be neither c$)$ nor d$)$. The flow rate of the
pump is strictly positive. Thus, a$)$ can't the answer. The b$)$
answer, $1$ m$^3$ per 10 minutes, is equivalent to $6$ m$^3$ per

We are looking for the equation of the relation between the number
of apples picked and the time.\\

Because the person picks ten apples a minute, the rate of change is
10. Moreover, at time zero, no apples are picked so the y-axis
intersect is null. So the equation is
$y=10x$.\\
Therefore, the answer is b$)$.\\

We are looking for the equation representing Kim's salary. Because
she always works 4 hours at 7 \$ an hour, she makes at least 28 \$
no matter how she sells. The y-axis intersect is then 28 \$. In this
case, the independent variable is the amount sold and the dependent
one is the total salary. The rate of change is 0,05 because she gets
5 \% of her total sales. The equation is then $S=28+0,05v$.\\
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\

gone from 345 \$ to 420 \$.\\

In five weeks, Catherine has saved 420 - 345 = 75 \$. The weekly
amount saved is found with the following division: $75$ \$$\div5$
weeks $=$ 15 \$ per weeks. The rate of change of the situation is 15.\\

Because Catherine already had 345 \$ in the beginning, the initial
value is 345. The equation is $E=15n+345$.\\
Therefore, the answer is a$)$.\\

We are looking for the equation representing the quantity of water

\begin{itemize}
\item there is 13 m$^3$ of water in the pool before emptying it;
\item after 30 minutes, there is 10 m$^3$ left in the pool.
\end{itemize}
In 30 minutes, the quantity of water has decreased of $13-10=3$
m$^3$. We find the variation per hour with: $-3$ m$^3\div 0,5$ hour
$=-6$ m$^3$ per hour. So the rate of change is $-6$.\\

The initial value is the quantity of water at the beginning, which is 13.\\
So the equation is $Q=13-6t$.\\
Therefore, the answer is b$)$.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item In an hotel, the price of a room for two for five days is 425 \$. For each
additional person there is an extra of 15 \$ a night.\\
So the price for the five days as a function of the number of
extra
people is $y=425+75x$ because 15 \$ is for only one night.\\
\item The base salary of a seller is 425 \$ a week. Also, he gets 15 \% of his
sales.\\
So his salary as a function of the sales is $y=425+0,15x$.\\
\item A collector already has 425 miniature cars. He wants to get 15 new ones each
decade.\\
So the number of car as a function of decades is $y=425+15x$.\\
\item A library has 425 books and buys 15 more each year.\\
So the number of books as a function of years is $y=425+15x$.\\

We are looking for the situations that can be represented by

\begin{itemize}
\item The surface of three identical squares whose side lengths varies.\\
So the surface as a function of the side lengths is $y=3\times
\textnormal{surface of a square}=3x^2$.
\item The surface of a circle whose radius varies.\\
So the surface as a function of the radius is $y=\pi x^2$.
\item The volume of a cone having 9 of height and whose radius varies.\\
So the volume as a function of the radius is
$y=\frac{\textnormal{Height}\times\textnormal{Surface of the
base}}{3}=\frac{9\pi x^2}{3}=3\pi x^2$.
\item The volume of a square base pyramid having 9 of height whose
base side length varies.\\
So the volume as a function of the base side length is
$y=\frac{\textnormal{Height}\times\textnormal{Surface of the

\end{itemize}
The situations 1 and 4 are right.\\

R\'etroaction:\\

We are looking for the surface of a square according to its side
length. The equation is then $y=x^2$ and not $y=\sqrt{x}$. The
equation $y=\sqrt{x}$

True or false?\\
The situation can be represented by this equation $y=\frac{500}{x}$.\\

Rponse : True\\

R\'etroaction:\\

The cost of the night is 500 \$ and is payed by the attendees, that
is, the cost is divided by the number of people $x$ attending the
party. So the equation $y=\frac{500}{x}$ represents
the price each attending person has to pay.\\
Therefore, the answer is : true.\\

R\'etroaction :\\

We are looking for the curve that represents the situation. Let $y$
be the amount of money and $x$ the time in years. Because the rate
of interest is 5 \% and that the initial amount is 5 000 \$, then
$y=5\,000\left(1,05\right)^{x}$ represents the situation.\\

The relation is exponential. It is then a curve that grows steeper
with time. That can be either $c$ or $d$.\\
We can calculate the amount after ten years to find the good one.
\begin{eqnarray*}
y&=& 5\,000\left(1,05\right)^{x}\\
&=& 5\,000\left(1,05\right)^{10}\\
&=& 5\,000\times 1,6289\\
&=& 8144,47
\end{eqnarray*}
Because $\left(10,\,\,8144,47\right)$ is right on the $d$ line, it
is the good one.

5 & 243\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

When the group number raises by one, the number of people reached is
multiplied by three. The relation is then an exponential of base
$3$, $y=3^x$. That is what's shown on the graphic. Lets try at
$x=8$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y&=&3^x\\

\item The series d$)$ is not a chain because there is no edge between vertexes $E$ and $F$ and then between $A$

For a graph to be Eulerian, there's got to be a simple cycle that

and 10 \$ if you get two identical faces. Otherwise, you don't win.
We are wondering what amount is reasonable to hope getting in return

We want both people to get to $B$ at the same time.\\


Suzanne does 1000 m at 6 km/h $=$ 6 000 m/h. It then takes her $10$
minutes to get at B.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{60\textnormal{ min}}{6\,000\textnormal{
m}}&=&\frac{x}{1\,000\textnormal{ m}}\\
\frac{60\textnormal{ min}\times1\,000\textnormal{
m}}{6\,000\textnormal{
m}}&=&x\\
10\textnormal{ min}&=&x
\end{eqnarray*}

Jenny runs at a speed of 9 km/h $=$ 9 000 m/h and she has to get to
B in 10 minutes. She does $1\,500$ m.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{9\,000\textnormal{
m}}{60\textnormal{ min}}&=&\frac{x}{10\textnormal{ min}}\\
\frac{9\,000\textnormal{
m}\times10\textnormal{ min}}{60\textnormal{ min}}&=&x\\
1\,500\textnormal{ m}&=&x
\end{eqnarray*}

Because
m$\overline{AC} = 900$ m, then m$\overline{BC} = 1\,500$ m $-\,900$ m $=600$ m.\\
Because we know the length of the three sides of the triangle, we
can find the angle $A$ with the cosine law.
\begin{eqnarray*}
a^2&=&b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A\\
600^2&=&900^2+1000^2-2\times900\times1000\times\cos A\\
360\,000&=&810\,000+1\,000\,000-1\,800\,000\times\cos A\\
-1\,450\,000&=&-1\,800\,000\times\cos A\\
\frac{-1\,450\,000}{-1\,800\,000}&=&\cos A\\
\frac{29}{36}&=&\cos A\\
\arccos\left(\frac{29}{36}\right)&=&A\\
36^\circ&\approx&A
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\

4338-- Jenny is out for a walk with her mother Suzanne. At $A$ on
their trip, they get to chose among two path to get to $B$. From
$A$, Jenny takes the long road and runs at nine kilometers an hour
while her mother is quick marching at six kilometer an hour on the
other road. Who will be waiting for the other at B? Jenny or
Suzanne?

Because the triangle is right angled, we can use the sine and cosine
to find the other sides lengths. Then we can find who will
be waiting for the other at $B$.\\

The segment $\overline{AC}$ measures 800 m.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos A &=& \frac{\textnormal{adjacent side}}{\textnormal{hypotenuse}}\\
\cos 36,9^\circ &=& \frac{\overline{AC}}{1000}\\
1000\times \cos 36,9^\circ &=&\overline{AC}\\
800&\approx&\overline{AC}
\end{eqnarray*}
and the segment $\overline{BC}$ measures 600 m.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sin A &=& \frac{\textnormal{opposite side}}{\textnormal{hypotenuse}}\\
\cos 36,9^\circ &=& \frac{\overline{BC}}{1000}\\
1000\times \cos 36,9^\circ &=&\overline{BC}\\
600&\approx&\overline{BC}
\end{eqnarray*}
The path taken by Jenny is 800 m $+\,600$ m
$=1\,400$ m long.\\

Because Jenny run at 9 km/h and that she must go 1\,400 m, we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{9\textnormal{ km}}{1\textnormal{ h}}&=& \frac{1\,400\textnormal{ m}}{x}\\
\frac{9\,000\textnormal{ m}}{60\textnormal{ min}}&=& \frac{1\,400\textnormal{ m}}{x}\\
9\,000\textnormal{ m}\times x &=& 1\,400\textnormal{ m}\times
60\textnormal{ min}\\
x &=& \frac{1\,400\textnormal{ m}\times
60\textnormal{ min}}{9\,000\textnormal{ m}}\\
x &\approx& 9,33 \textnormal{ min}
\end{eqnarray*}
Because Suzanne walks at 6 km/h and that she has to go 1\,000 m, we
have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{6\textnormal{ km}}{1\textnormal{ h}}&=& \frac{1\,000\textnormal{ m}}{x}\\
\frac{6\,000\textnormal{ m}}{60\textnormal{ min}}&=& \frac{1\,000\textnormal{ m}}{x}\\
6\,000\textnormal{ m}\times x &=& 1\,000\textnormal{ m}\times
60\textnormal{ min}\\
x &=& \frac{1\,000\textnormal{ m}\times
60\textnormal{ min}}{6\,000\textnormal{ m}}\\
x &=& 10 \textnormal{ min}
\end{eqnarray*}
It takes Jenny 9,33 minutes to get to $B$ and 10 minutes to her
mother. Jenny will have to wait $10$ minutes $-9,33$ minutes
$=0,67$ minutes $=40$ seconds before her mother arrives.\\
Therefore, the answer is Jenny.\\

We are looking for the surface of the lawn. We know the house
occupies 128 square meters, the paved entrance 80 square meters and
the pool is made of two half-circles and a rectangle. The pool is 3
meter wide and 10 meters long.
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{geo339.eps}
 % alg77.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
Before finding the surface, the length of the base of the triangle
has to be found. Because it is a right angled triangle, Pythagoras
relation gives:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a^2+b^2 &=& c^2\\
a^2+10^2&=&24^2\\
a^2+100&=&576\\
a^2&=&476\\
a&\approx&21,82
\end{eqnarray*}

The surface of the lot is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_\textnormal{lot} &=&
A_\textnormal{square}+A_\textnormal{triangle}\\
&=& c^2 + \frac{b\times h}{2}\\
&=& 24^2 + \frac{21,82\times 10}{2}\\
&=& 576 + 109,10\\
&=& 685,10
\end{eqnarray*}

The width of the pool corresponds to the diameter of the two
half-circles. The surface of the pool:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_\textnormal{pool} &=&
A_\textnormal{circle}+A_\textnormal{rectangle}\\
&=& \pi r^2 + b\times h\\
&=& \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 + (\textnormal{length}-2r)\times 3\\
&=& \pi \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 + (10-3)\times 3\\
&=& \pi \frac{9}{4} + 7\times 3\\
&=& \frac{9}{4}\pi +21\\
&\approx& 28,07
\end{eqnarray*}
So the surface of the lawn is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_\textnormal{lawn} &=&
A_\textnormal{lot}-A_\textnormal{pool}-A_\textnormal{house}-A_\textnormal{entrance}\\
&=& 685,10-28,07-128-80\\
&=& 449,03
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the answer is a$)$.\\

R\'eponse: True\\

R\'etroaction:\\
We know that the triangles are isosceles and that they have the same
base and the same surface. With the base and surface, we find the
height. So the height is the same in both triangles. There is only
one way an isosceles triangle can be if the base and the height are
the same, so they are identical.\\
Therefore, the answer is : true.\\

4342-- True or false?\\
In space, the locus of points equidistant from a segment is the
lateral surface of a cylinder. For example, the locus two
centimeters away from a four centimeters long segment is the lateral
surface of a cylinder of two centimeters of radius and 4
centimeters of height which central axis is the segment in question.\\

R\'eponse: False\\

R\'etroaction:\\

In space, the locus of points equidistant from a segment is the
lateral surface of a cylinder around the segment of the surface of
two half-spheres on the tips of that segment. In fact, it is the
lateral surface of a cylinder on which you put two half-sphere on
the bases.

Gabriel is right because the triangle is right angled. With
Pythagoras' relation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
d(A, B)^2&=&d(A, C)^2+d(B, C)^2\\
d(A, B)&=&\sqrt{15^2+10^2}\\
d(A, B)&=&\sqrt{225+100}\\
d(A, B)&=&\sqrt{325}

Because the segment linking the points is on an horizontal line, we
only need to calculate the absolute value of the difference between
the ordinates of those points to find the distance separating them.
\begin{eqnarray*}
d(\left(3, -2\right), \left(-6, -2\right))&=&|-6-3|\\
&=&|-9|\\

Therefore, the answer is 9.\\

 % alg77.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}

Because the segment linking the points is oblique, we have to make a
right angled triangle and use Pythagoras' relation.
\begin{eqnarray*}
d(\left(3, -2\right), \left(-3, 10\right))&=&\sqrt{(3-(-3))^2+(-2-10)^2}\\
&=&\sqrt{6^2+(-12)^2}\\

We can see on the graphic that the point s on the first half of the
segment starts from $\left(3, -2\right)$. Let $\left(3, -2\right)$
be the point 1 and $\left(-3, 10\right)$ the point 2.
\begin{eqnarray*}
P&=&\left(x_1+a(x_2-x_1),y_1+a(y_2-y_1)\right)\\
\left(1,5,\, 1\right)&=&\left(3+a(-3-3),-2+a(10-(-2))\right)\\
\left(1,5,\, 1\right)&=&\left(3+a(-6),-2+a(12)\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item For the abscissae we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
1,5&=&3+a(-6)\\
-1,5&=&-6a\\
\frac{-1,5}{-6}&=&a\\
\frac{1}{4}&=&a

\item For the ordinates we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
1&=&-2+a(12)\\
3&=&12a\\
\frac{3}{12}&=&a\\
\frac{1}{4}&=&a
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{itemize}
The segment made of $\left(3, -2\right)$ and $\left(1,5\,,\,
1\right)$ represents the fourth of the initial segment. It is split in a ratio 1 : 3.\\
Therefore, the answer is a$)$.\\

\begin{eqnarray*}

We are looking for the probability of a bird relieving himself over

because it is 3 meters wide and 10 meters long.

 % alg77.eps: 1048592x1048592 pixel, 0dpi\begin{center}
\end{center}
Before finding the surface of the courtyard, we have to find the
base of the triangle. Because it is right angled, we have according
to Pythagoras' relation:
\begin{eqnarray*}
a^2+b^2 &=& c^2\\
a^2+10^2&=&24^2\\
a^2+100&=&576\\
a^2&=&476\\
a&\approx&21,82
\end{eqnarray*}

The surface of the courtyard is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_\textnormal{courtyard} &=&
A_\textnormal{square}+A_\textnormal{triangle}\\
&=& c^2 + \frac{b\times h}{2}\\
&=& 24^2 + \frac{21,82\times 10}{2}\\
&=& 576 + 109,10\\
&=& 685,10
\end{eqnarray*}

The width of the pool corresponds to the diameter of the two
half-circles. The surface of the pool is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_\textnormal{pool} &=&
A_\textnormal{circle}+A_\textnormal{rectangle}\\
&=& \pi r^2 + b\times h\\
&=& \pi \left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 + (\textnormal{length}-2r)\times 3\\

&=& \pi \frac{9}{4} + 7\times 3\\

\end{eqnarray*}
So the probability that it does its business in the pool is:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textnormal{P(pool})&=&\frac{A_\textnormal{pool}}{A_\textnormal{courtyard}}\\
&=&\frac{28,07}{685,10}\\

With the equation, we know that the center of the hyperbola is at

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{(x-3)^2}{16}-\frac{(y-4)^2}{35}&=&1\\
\frac{(x-3)^2}{4\times4}&=&1+\frac{(y-4)^2}{35}\\
\frac{(x-3)^2}{4}&=&4(1+\frac{(y-4)^2}{35})\\
\frac{(x-3)^2}{4}&=&4+\frac{4(y-4)^2}{35}
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{(x-3)^2}{4}+\frac{(y-6)^2}{25}&=&1\\
4+\frac{4(y-4)^2}{35}+\frac{(y-6)^2}{25}&=&1\\
\frac{4(y-4)^2}{35}+\frac{(y-6)^2}{25}&=&-3\\
\frac{4(y^2-8y+16)}{35}+\frac{(y^2-12y+36)}{25}&=&-3\\
350\times\frac{4(y^2-8y+16)}{35}+350\frac{(y^2-12y+36)}{25}&=&-3\times350\\
40(y^2-8y+16)+14(y^2-12y+36)&=&-1050\\
40y^2-320y+640+14y^2-168y+504&=&-1050\\
54y^2-488y+2194&=&0
\end{eqnarray*}
With the formula giving the zeros of a quadratic function we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
y&=&\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\
&=&\frac{488\pm\sqrt{(-488)^2-4\times54\times2194}}{2\times54}\\
&=&\frac{488\pm\sqrt{238\,144-473\,904}}{108}\\
&=&\frac{488\pm\sqrt{-235\,760}}{108}

Because the square root of a negative number is not in $\mathbb{R}$,
there is no intersection between the conic sections.\\

b$)$ \ldots an ellipse.\\

d$)$ \ldots a dot.\\

R\'eponse: d$)$\\

R\'etroaction:\\

The conic section of equation $(x-4)^2+(y-5)^2=0$ is a dot because
the equation is similar to one of a circle. However, because the
radius is null, it can be a circle. It's a dot.\\
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\

4412-- The equation $-16x^2+36y^2+64x-640=0$ is one of\ldots\\

To find the conic section represented by the equation, we have to
get the canonical form of the equation.
\begin{eqnarray*}
-16x^2+36y^2+64x-640&=&0\\
36y^2-16x^2+64x&=&640\\
36y^2-16(x^2-4x+\cdots)&=&640-16(\cdots)\\
36y^2-16(x^2-4x+4)&=&640-16(4)\\
36y^2-16(x-2)^2&=&640-64\\
36y^2-16(x-2)^2&=&576\\
\frac{y^2}{16}-\frac{(x-2)^2}{36}&=&1

That equation is one of an hyperbola.\\
Therefore, the answer is c$)$.\\

d$)$ We set hypotheses and a conclusion. The proof allows to

R\'eponse: d$)$\\

R\'etroaction:\\

In a proof by contradiction, hypotheses and a conclusion are set as
in all proofs. That proof allows to conclude that the negative of
the conclusion is true because a contradiction appears in the
proof.\\

Here's an example of proof by contradiction.\\

On an island, there are two types of residents: the liars that
always lie and the honest ones that always tell the truth. A man
says : \og I'm a liar. \fg\, Is he a resident of the island?\\
\begin{itemize}
\item If he is a resident of the island and he is a liar, then he is
lying. But he said the truth by saying he is a liar. So he can't
be a resident because a liar never tells the truth.
\item If he is a resident and is honest, then he is saying the truth.
But he lied saying he was a liar. So he can't be a resident
because
he is honest by lies.\\
\end{itemize}
By contradiction, we demonstrate that the man is not a resident of the island.\\
Therefore, the answer is d$)$.\\

4414-- On this circle, $\angle AOB$ measures 60$^\circ$ and the arc
$\overset{\frown}{BD}$ measures 240 cm. What is the length in
centimeters of the arc $\overset{\frown}{AC}$ if it corresponds to
the four ninths of the circumference of the circle?

 \includegraphics[width=5cm]{geo414.eps}

\end{center}
Because the arc $\overset{\frown}{AC}$ corresponds to the four
ninths of the circumference of the circle, $\angle AOC$ measures
$\frac{4}{9}\times 360^\circ=160^\circ$. Because $\angle AOB$ and
$\angle COD$ are congruent, $\angle COD$ measures 60$^\circ$. The
sum of the angles at the center of a circle is 360$^\circ$. $\angle
BOD$ measures
$360^\circ-(60^\circ\times2+160^\circ)=360^\circ-280^\circ=80^\circ$.
We find the length of the arc $\overset{\frown}{AC}$ with the
following ratio.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{80^\circ}{240 \textnormal{ cm}}&=&\frac{160^\circ}{x}\\
80^\circ\times x&=& 160^\circ \times 240 \textnormal{ cm}\\
x&=& \frac{160^\circ \times 240\textnormal{ cm}}{80^\circ}\\
x&=& 480\textnormal{ cm}
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, the answer is 480.\\

All right bisectors of the chords of a circle pass through its
center.\\

R\'eponse: True\\

R\'etroaction:\\

By definition, all points on a right bisector of a chord are
equidistant from both tips of the chord. Because the circle is the
locus of points equidistant from a fixed point and that both tips of
a chord belong to the circle, the center of the circle is inevitably
on the right bisector of the circle's chords.\\
Therefore, the answer is : true.\\

Because the circle is the locus of the points equidistant from a
fixed point, we have to find the intersection of the right bisectors
of points that are on the circle in order to find the center of the
circle. One of the right bisector is $y=2x-1$. From points $(-5,
-6)$ and (4, -3) we find an other right bisector whose equation is
$y=-3x-6$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The middle point of those two points is $\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{9}{2}\right)$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
M&=&\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)\\
&=&\left(\frac{-5+4}{2}, \frac{-6+-3}{2}\right)\\
&=&\left(-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{9}{2}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
\item The equation of the straight line is $y=-3x-6$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
m' &=&\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\\
-3&=&\frac{-\frac{9}{2}-y}{-\frac{1}{2}-x}\\
-3\times(-\frac{1}{2}-x)&=&-\frac{9}{2}-y\\
\frac{3}{2}+3x&=&-\frac{9}{2}-y\\
y&=&-\frac{3}{2}-3x-\frac{9}{2}\\
y&=&-3x-6
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{itemize}
The intersection of the two right bisectors is the center of the
circle, it is the point $(-1, -3)$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
-3x-6&=&2x-1\\
-5&=&5x\\
-1&=&x
\end{eqnarray*}
et
\begin{eqnarray*}
y&=&2x-1\\
y&=&2(-1)-1\\
y&=&-3

Therefore, the answer is c$)$.\\

Because tangents make a right angle with the radius of a circle at
their point of tangency, the angles $\angle CAO$ and $\angle CBO$
are congruent. Because the point $C$ is the intersection of two
tangents of a same circle, the segment $\overline{OC}$ is the
bisector of the angle $\angle ACB$ and the angles $\angle ACO$ and
$\angle BCO$ are congruent. The triangles $\triangle AOC$ and
$\triangle BOC$ have the segment $\overline{OC}$ in common that is
between the two pairs of congruent angles on the two triangles. So
the triangles $\triangle AOC$ and $\triangle BOC$ are congruent. For
that, we can say that the segments
$\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$ are congruent.\\

The size of the inscribed angle is half of that of the arc between

the arc $\overset{\frown}{AB}$ that measures $180^\circ$. So $\angle

We are looking for the size of the angle $\angle BDE$ knowing that
the arc $\overset{\frown}{ADE}$
measures $140^\circ$ and that $\overline{AB}$ is a diameter of the circle.\\

Because $\overline{AB}$ is a diameter, the arc
$\overset{\frown}{ADB}$ measures $180^\circ$. We also have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textnormal{m} \overset{\frown}{ADB} &=&\textnormal{m}\overset{\frown}{ADE} +\textnormal{m}\overset{\frown}{BE}\\
180^\circ&=&140^\circ+\textnormal{m}\overset{\frown}{BE}\\
40&=&\textnormal{m}\overset{\frown}{BE}

Because $\angle ADF$ is an inscribed angle that underlies the arc

60^\circ&=&\frac{\textnormal{m}\overset{\frown}{AD}}{2}\\

We are looking for the size of the angle $\angle FDV$.\\
The circumference of the circle is $C=\pi d=\pi\times7,32$ meters
$\approx23$ meters. The size of the arc $\overset{\frown}{DF}$ is

The arc $\overset{\frown}{FV}$ measures
$360^\circ-(110^\circ+141^\circ)=109^\circ$. The angle $\angle FDV$
then measures:
\begin{eqnarray*}
