#This script deletes the stats for the time period specified by the first

#0 = week stats 
#1 = month stats 
#2 = since creation (you don't want to to this)
#anything else is illegal

#It only deletes the _summary_ stats, the _full_ stats aren't touched
#It needs to be executable, and should be run regularly by a cron job 
#(see crontab.example)
