To run the Smac GUI
-------------------

1) Use the 'new' tex2swf.sh script.  You'll have to specify the
location of this new script in the GUI.  Older scripts may work but
they may also not work (which is much more likely).  Make sure it is
executable.

2) java -jar SmacGUI.jar

3) Using the GUI is, I hope, self-explanatory.
   a) Visit the Parser,Export to DB and DB tab.  Set the parameters.
   b) Go to Main tab
   c) The 'Parse' button checks if the files are formatted properly
   d) The 'Export' button adds the questions contained in those files
      to the DB.  Note that the 'Export' button will start by parsing
      and abort if the parsing fails.

4) Some help on patterns in the 'Parser' tab.
  Although you can use complex regular expression, all you need to
  know is that 
    a) the patterns perform SUBSTRING matching 
    b) * means any substring
    ex) SF*4*.tex would match both SFA84.tex and CaribooSF4_Section1.tex

Optional:
You may want to edit the file SmacGUI.jar/latextomej.ini to specify
proper MySQL DB connection info.  This is not necessary because you 
can provide that information through the GUI.

One way to edit a file located in a .jar archive is to use emacs.
You can pretend the .jar file is just a regular file and emacs will
guide you through the rest.


Also:
It's possible you'll need to have a mysql-connector-java-X.X.X-bin.jar
on your machine (and tell java where to find it).  There's one on my
site just one directory up from this one.
